## Sanitize Email – Landing Page Redesign

This is a case study on how i tried making an email validation website ( Sanitize email) clearer, modern, and easier to use.

## Overview

Sanitize Email is a tool that helps businesses verify email addresses to reduce bounce rates and improve deliverability. I decided to redesign this website because the old website had the right information but looked outdated, crowded, and hard to follow.<br>

My goal was to redesign the landing page to make it look cleaner, easier to understand, and more effective at guiding users to take action.

## What I Wanted to Achieve

- Make the website easier to read and navigate.
- Highlight important buttons like “Validate Email” and “Start Free Trial”.
- Build trust with a clean, professional look.
- Organize sections so users understand what the tool does quickly.

## What I Noticed in the Original Design

- The layout felt crowded and overwhelming.
- The main buttons didn’t stand out enough because of color they used is too strong than primary color.
- There are no clear path to guide visitors through features and benefits.
- Important sections like testimonials were hard to read and cannot stand out.

## My Role

I worked on this project by myself as a personal design challenge. I planned the new layout, designed the wireframes, and created the final user interface in Figma.

## Tools Used

- Figma
- Photoshop

## Design Process

## Research

I looked at other email validation websites to see what makes them easy to use. I paid attention to layouts, CTA buttons, and how they explain features. I also reviewed SaaS landing pages to learn how they build trust.
